Video Generation with Python
---

Setting up environment:

- **[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) is required**
- **[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is optional but recomended to
prevent conflicts with Python versions intalled in your local environment**

To set up Python version with Pyenv use:

``` bash
$ pyenv install
```

Once pipenv is installed, from the root of this project run:

``` bash
$ pipenv install
```

To run [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) use:

``` bash
$ pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

Automatically your default web browser will pop up with all the notebooks
from this presentation.
